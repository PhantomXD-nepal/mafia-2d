# ðŸŽ® Multiplayer Social Deduction Game - Dev Plan

A 7-player browser-based game inspired by *Among Us* / *Mafia*, built with **FastAPI (Python)** + **React (Frontend)** + **WebSockets**.

---

## 1. Project Setup

### Backend (Python - FastAPI)
1. Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # Linux/Mac
   venv\Scripts\activate      # Windows
````

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install fastapi uvicorn[standard] python-socketio[client] redis sqlalchemy
   ```

3. Project structure:

   ```
   backend/
   â”œâ”€â”€ main.py         # FastAPI app entry
   â”œâ”€â”€ game.py         # Game logic (roles, turns, actions)
   â”œâ”€â”€ models.py       # Database models (if using SQLAlchemy)
   â”œâ”€â”€ state.py        # In-memory/Redis game state
   â””â”€â”€ requirements.txt
   ```

### Frontend (React + Phaser.js)

1. Create project:

   ```bash
   npx create-react-app frontend
   cd frontend
   npm install socket.io-client phaser
   ```

2. Project structure:

   ```
   frontend/
   â”œâ”€â”€ src/
   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ App.js          # Lobby/game UI
   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ GameCanvas.js   # Phaser game rendering
   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ sockets.js      # Socket.io client setup
   ```

## 2. Core Features

### Roles

* **Nightmare** (evil) â€“ hides as good if inspected.
* **Witch** (evil) â€“ inspects someoneâ€™s role, shares with Nightmare.
* **Detective** â€“ inspects one player per night.
* **Duant** â€“ links to a target, if killed â†’ target dies too.
* **Joker** â€“ wins if voted out.
* **King** â€“ has 2 lives.
* **Common Villager(s)** â€“ good, no special powers.

### Game Phases

1. **Lobby** â€“ players join until 7 connected.
2. **Role Assignment** â€“ server secretly assigns roles.
3. **Night Phase**

   * Witch acts â†’ inspects someone.
   * Witch + Nightmare agree â†’ kill one person.
   * Detective inspects â†’ sees "good/evil".
   * Duant selects a target.
4. **Day Phase**

   * Narrator announces who died.
   * Voting happens (majority vote â†’ elimination).
   * Check win conditions.
5. **Repeat** until win condition met:

   * All evil dead â†’ good wins.
   * Evil >= good â†’ evil wins.
   * Joker voted out â†’ Joker wins.

## 3. Backend Implementation (FastAPI)

### main.py (entry point)

* Start FastAPI app.
* Setup **WebSocket routes** for:

  * `/ws/lobby/{room_id}` â€“ handle player connections.
  * `/ws/game/{room_id}` â€“ manage game state/events.

### game.py (game logic)

* Functions:

  * `assign_roles(players)`
  * `start_night_phase()`
  * `process_votes()`
  * `check_win_conditions()`

### state.py

* Store game state (players, roles, alive/dead, votes).
* Use **Redis** or in-memory dictionary.

---

## 4. Frontend Implementation (React)

### sockets.js

* Setup **socket.io-client** to connect to FastAPI backend.

### App.js

* Lobby screen â†’ enter name, join room.
* Once 7 players connected â†’ transition to game.

### GameCanvas.js

* Show player avatars, chat, voting UI.
* Render 2D game board (optional, via Phaser.js).

---

## 5. Database (Optional)

* Use **PostgreSQL (Supabase)** for:

  * Persistent accounts.
  * Game history.
* Or skip â†’ just use Redis/memory for faster prototyping.

---

## 6. Hosting

* **Frontend**: Vercel or Netlify (`npm run build`).
* **Backend**: Render, Fly.io, or Railway (`uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000`).
* **Database**: Supabase (Postgres) or Upstash (Redis).

---

## 7. Milestones

1. âœ… Setup FastAPI server + WebSockets.
2. âœ… Setup React frontend + Socket.IO client.
3. âœ… Implement lobby + role assignment.
4. âœ… Implement night phase actions.
5. âœ… Implement day phase + voting.
6. âœ… Add win conditions.
7. âœ… Add animations / UI polish with Phaser.js.
8. ðŸš€ Deploy to production.

---

## 8. Optional Enhancements

* Voice chat (WebRTC).
* Mobile-friendly UI.
* Authentication (Supabase Auth).
* Ranking/leaderboards.

---

# ðŸŽ¯ Goal

By following this plan, youâ€™ll have a **fully playable 7-player social deduction game** running in the browser with a **Python backend** and **React frontend**.
